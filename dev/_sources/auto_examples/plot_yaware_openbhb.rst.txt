Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning with y-Aware
===================================================

This tutorial will show you how to fit and evaluate a y-Aware Contrastive
Learning model on the OpenBHB dataset using NIDL. As in the original paper
[1]_, we will use age as a weak label to guide the contrastive learning
process. The model will be trained to bring representations of samples with
similar ages closer together in the feature space, while pushing apart samples
with dissimilar ages. This approach leverages the age information to enhance
the quality of the learned representations, making them more relevant for
downstream tasks such as age prediction or disease classification.

We will follow these steps using the NIDL library:

1. Load the OpenBHB dataset.
2. Define the data augmentations for weakly-supervised training.
3. Define the y-Aware Contrastive Learning model.
4. Train the model using the weak labels.
5. Visualize the model's embedding using MDS and evaluate its
   performance on age prediction using linear regression and KNN.

As for the neuroimaging data, we will investigate two input representations:

- Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) maps, which are preprocessed gray matter
  density maps.
- Surface-based morphometry (SBM) maps, which are cortical thickness, mean
  curvature, gray matter volume and surface area maps projected onto a
  standard surface template.

  Both representations are available in the OpenBHB dataset. To make the
  training faster and reduce the memory footprint, we will consider regions
  of interest (ROIs) instead of the whole brain. For VBM, we will
  use the mean gray matter density averaged within each ROI of the
  Neuromorphometrics atlas (284 regions). For SBM, we will use the cortical
  thickness, mean curvature, gray matter volume and surface area averaged
  within each ROI of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (68 regions).

  The y-Aware Contrastive Learning model will be trained individually on both
  representations and we will compare their performance on age prediction.

OpenBHB datasets and data augmentations for Contrastive Learning
----------------------------------------------------------------

We will use the OpenBHB dataset for pre-training the models. We will focus
on the VBM ROI representation and the SBM ROI representation for this
tutorial. Since they are tabular data, we will use random masking and
adding Gaussian noise as data augmentation in contrastive learning.

Training of y-Aware Contrastive Learning models
-----------------------------------------------

We can now instantiate and train two y-Aware Contrastive Learning models (one
for VBM and another for SBM). We use the age as weak label to impose similar
representations of samples with close age for both models.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 246-250

Since we work with tabular data, we can use a simple MLP as encoder. For
VBM data, the input dimension is 284 and we compress the data to a 32-d
vector. SBM data is flattened to a 272-d vector (68 regions * 4 features)
and we also compress it to a 32-d vector.

We limit the training to 10 epochs for the sake of time and we use a small
bandwidth for the Gaussian kernel in the y-Aware model compared to the
variance of the age in OpenBHB (sigma=4 vs std(age)=15).

Visualization and evaluation of the learned representations
--------------------------------------------------------------

In order to visualize the learned representations of both models, we apply
a widely used dimensionality reduction technique: Multi-Dimensional Scaling
(MDS). This technique project the points in a lower-dimensional space such
that the pairwise distances between points are preserved as much as possible.
Then, we evaluate the learned representations on age prediction using linear
regression and KNN regression.

We first extract the embeddings of the training and test sets for both VBM
and SBM data.

**Observations**: From the MDS visualizations, we can observe that both VBM
and SBM embeddings show a gradient of ages, indicating that the models have
learned to organize the data in a way that reflects age similarity. However,
the VBM embeddings appear to have a more continuous distribution of ages
compared to SBM. This suggests that VBM may capture age-related features
more effectively than SBM in this context. This is confirmed when looking at
the age prediction results, where VBM outperforms SBM for both linear
regression and KNN regression. However, the results can be improved by
working with the original 3d brain scans instead of the ROI-averaged data.

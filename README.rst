- `Release notes <./CHANGELOG.rst>`_


Content
-------

Nidl provides unified deep learning interfaces (compatible with `PyTorch Lightning <https://lightning.ai/pytorch-lightning>`_) to analyze brain volumes and surfaces. It also provides a way to describe your experiments using a single configuration file (for production, a more advanced tool is availble in `Hydra <https://hydra.cc>`_).


Where to start
--------------

Examples are available in the `gallery <https://neurospin-deepinsight.github.io/nidl/auto_gallery/index.html>`_. You can also refer to the `API documentation <https://neurospin-deepinsight.github.io/nidl/generated/documentation.html>`_.


Install
-------

The code is tested for the current stable PyTorch and torchvision versions, but should work with other versions as well. Make sure you have installed all the package dependencies. Complete instructions are available `here <https://neurospin-deepinsight.github.io/nidl/generated/installation.html>`_.
